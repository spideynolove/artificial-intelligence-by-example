# CH03 Code Summary

### Chapter Topics Explained  
This chapter addresses **evaluating and validating MDP-driven AI decision-making processes** in complex environments (e.g., warehouse AGV navigation) using two core principles and practical tools:  

---

#### **Principle 1**:  
AI algorithms (e.g., MDP/Q-learning) **outperform humans** in multi-parameter decision-making (e.g., AGV path optimization) by efficiently processing large datasets and balancing trade-offs.  
- Example: The Q-learning agent in `mdp03.py` learns optimal paths (e.g., F→D→C) through 50k training episodes, surpassing human intuition in large warehouses.  

---

#### **Principle 2**:  
**Verifying AI decisions** is challenging due to complexity. The chapter introduces **evaluation frameworks** to bridge this gap:  

1. **Numerical Convergence Measurement** (`mdp03.py`):  
   - Tracks Q-matrix stability by comparing sum(Q) across episodes.  
   - Stops training when `|Q_new − Q_old| < threshold`, ensuring policy reliability.  
   ```python
   if (conv == Q.sum()): break  # Training stops if Q stabilizes
   ```  

2. **Decision Tree Validation** (`Decision_Tree_Priority_classifier.py`):  
   - Validates reward matrix decisions using human-interpretable rules.  
   - Example: Classifies AGV priority levels (High/Low) based on features like `Priority/location` (≤360) and `Flow_optimizer`.  
   - Output: `warehouse_example_decision_tree.png` shows logic for prioritization (e.g., `Priority/location ≤ 360 → Low`).

### **Key Tools & Workflows**  
- **MDP/Q-Learning**:  
  - **Reward Matrix (R)**: Defines valid AGV transitions (e.g., `R[C][C] = 100` for goal state).  
  - **Q-Matrix**: Learned through Bellman updates (`Q(s,a) = R(s,a) + γ·max(Q(s',a'))`).  
  - **Convergence Check**: Ensures Q-values stabilize (numerical gradient descent).  

- **Decision Tree**:  
  - **Features**: `Priority/location`, `Volume`, `Flow_optimizer`.  
  - **Role**: Acts as a "sanity check" to ensure AI decisions align with domain logic (e.g., shorter paths prioritized).  

---

### **Example Validation Pipeline**  
1. **Train MDP**: Generate Q-matrix via `mdp03.py`.  
2. **Check Convergence**: Verify Q-sum stabilizes (e.g., derivative ≈ 0).  
3. **Decision Tree Analysis**: Confirm AGV paths match priority rules (e.g., high-priority zones align with `Flow_optimizer=1`).

### **Outcome**  
Combines **AI-driven decision-making** (Q-learning) with **interpretable validation** (decision trees) to address Principles 1 and 2, ensuring reliable AGV navigation in warehouses.
